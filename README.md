## Prerequisites
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Concept
* Model receives X notes and predicts next note
* The note consists of `(pitch, step, duration)`
* From predicted notes a song is generated by a script using a provided model
* There are 3 architectures `[gan, lstm, ResNet]`

## Classes of pitches
